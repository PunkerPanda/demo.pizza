=== project description
You will be writing a small app for a small pizza parlour. This
pizza parlour has 1 pizza with three optional toppings. It's very
sad.

Design two database tables. One is a customer table. One is a
pizza table, you can use a column for each ingredient. Each pizza
order generates a record in the pizza table, tied to a customer.

Next, design and implement a PHP program to capture pizza
orders. Your solution will be evaluated on both the quality of the
design and the quality of the implementation. List any frameworks
that you use.
